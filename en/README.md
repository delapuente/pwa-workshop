# PWA Workshop

> Visita la [versión en español del taller](../es/).

The [PWA Workshop](https://delapuente.github.io/pwa-workshop/) aims at providing a step-by-step guide to integrate the core technologies of the so-called PWA: Service Workers, Web Manifest and Push Notifications.

The Recommendations utility is a _single-view_ application although it does not fit the [SPA definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) since there are real navigations between URLs even when they present the same view.

The project at different points of the workshop:

  2. [PWA Workshop @ step 2](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/pwa-workshop-step2)
  3. [PWA Workshop @ step 3](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/pwa-workshop-step3)
  4. [Project complete: Recommendations app](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/recommendations)
